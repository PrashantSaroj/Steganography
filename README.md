Steganography is science of hiding message inside another message. In this case, a LZW compressed message is hidden in image using simple matrix manipulations.
Libraries used: PIL for image manipulation and math.
Instruction for hiding the message:
1. Python3 must be used.
2. Rename your image file as input.png and put it in same directory as encode.py
3. Run the program as usually you will run any other python program. 
4. You will be prompted to enter your message.
5. After entering message, a file output.png will be generated.

Instruction for retrieving the message.
1. Image file must be named output.png and put it in same directory as decode.py
2. Run the decode.py using Python3.
